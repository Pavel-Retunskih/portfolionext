  title: 'where_am_I_going',
  description: "Currently, I am diving deeper into server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) to enhance my understanding of building highly optimized web applications. These concepts help improve page load times, SEO, and overall performance. I am learning Next.js as it offers a powerful framework for implementing SSR and SSG, allowing me to create fast and SEO-friendly websites with ease.In addition to Next.js, I'm exploring backend technologies like Express and NestJS. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. On the other hand, NestJS is a full-fledged framework that leverages TypeScript and provides an out-of-the-box architecture for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.Overall, my learning journey is focused on building full-stack applications with modern technologies that prioritize performance, maintainability, and scalability."
